The "Serverless Literature Dataset" (2nd generation)

In February 2018, we have published the first iteration of the SLD
online at https://zenodo.org/record/1175424. It contained 34 works
retrieved via DBLP and organised in a spreadsheet. In September 2018, we
extended it with more recent publication, yielding 44 works. Due to
additional metadata, we quickly hit the limit of spreadsheet
representation and resorted to this more sophisticated set of JSON
files which allow for easier processing and textual change tracking.

Installation:
- % sudo apt-get install python3-pybtex / pip3 install pybtex
- % sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib-venn / pip3 ...
- % sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

The basic curation workflow is as follows:
- add a DOI to serverless-literature-base.json
- run populate.py to produce serverless-literature-bibliography.json
  from this file
- if no DOI is available, add relevant fields directly to
  serverless-literature-bibliography.json and leave an empty entry in
  the base file
- commit the results

Ensure that each key in serverless-literature-base.json is unique! All
other checks, in particular consecutiveness, will be checked for by the
tool.

The advanced curation workflow is as follows:
- run analysischeck.py
- follow the advice, extend serverless-literature-analysis.json
  and serverless-literature-technologies.json appropriately

Once all data has been checked, statistics output can be produced as by
the following instructions:
- run stats.py
- run tagcloud.py (if folder 'pdfs/' with files '<number>.pdf' exists)
- run venn.py
- run venue.py
